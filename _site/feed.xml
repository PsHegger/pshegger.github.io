        <description>&lt;p&gt;As you can see this is the first post here, so I thought I’ll write a bit about myself (don’t worry, later I’ll write only about development).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Gergely Hegedüs and I was born in Hungary. I started to learn programming in 2006 (when I was only 14) by learning Pascal from an old book. Later I learnt PHP and C# which was followed by Java and later Python. Currently I’m working as an Android developer at a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tappointment.com/mainpage/&quot;&gt;Tappointment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my free time I like to play some games or simply lie in the bed and read Reddit all day long. I’m also learning Kung Fu, which became my lifestyle and my most important after-work activity.&lt;/p&gt;
