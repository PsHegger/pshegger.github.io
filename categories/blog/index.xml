      <description>This year’s h@cktivitycon was held last Saturday, but even before it started, there was another event HackerOne had organized: this year’s CTF. It began on Thursday and ran for 48 hours. As I wasn’t following the events, it was already Friday when I realized it was running. I still had a bit more than a day to complete as many challenges as possible, so I decided to register and see how it goes.</description>

      <title>Advent of Code 2020</title>

      <description>The 2020 Advent of Code ended less than a week ago, and I thought the best way to cope with the void it left behind is writing a post about how I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it. This was my 5th year I jumped into it, but only the first one I actually did all the tasks. Just a small warning, this post contains some minor spoilers.
This year my aim was to do all the tasks as fast as possible, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a new language.</description>
