      <description>Write once, use everywhere Sooner or later every developer meets the following scenario: you have written the same piece of code multiple times, maybe with some minor differences, and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it again. You analyze the situation and decide to create a separate function so the next time you need it you just have to call it. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not enough so you create a new abstraction layer and write a class which does what you need.</description>

      <title>Help Yourself and the Compiler with Contracts</title>

      <description>What are contracts? In the world of Kotlin, contracts represent a deal between the developer and the compiler. As a developer you can share insight of your code with the compiler and it can use this extra info for better code analysis.
Currently there are two kinds of contracts available: callsInPlace which tells the compiler how many times a lambda is called, and returns/implies which indicates that a defined condition is true if the function returns a specific value.</description>
