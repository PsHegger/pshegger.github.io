{"name":"pshegger","tagline":"","body":"## About me\r\nMy name is Gergely Hegedüs and this is a short website about me and my work for those who are interested in it. Currently I live in Budapest, Hungary and work as an Android Developer at [Tappointment](https://www.tappointment.com/web/login.php).\r\n\r\nIn my free time I like to play video games or hang out with my friends, but my biggest passion is Kung Fu what I try to practice as much as possible. I also like to make cool things be it a usefull tool or a game.\r\n\r\n## Personal Projects\r\nEvery time I see something cool on the Internet my imagination starts to fly, and sometimes it ends up as something new and (hopefully) great which in time will make its way here.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me if you have any kind of question/suggestion or just want to have a nice chat with me.\r\n* Email: <pshegger@gmail.com>\r\n* Twitter: [@pshegger](https://twitter.com/pshegger)\r\n* Facebook: [Gergely Hegedüs](https://www.facebook.com/gergely.hegedus)\r\n* Github @PsHegger","google":"UA-72812058-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
