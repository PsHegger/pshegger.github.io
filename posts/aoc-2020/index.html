  <div class="post-content"><p>The <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">2020 Advent of Code</a> ended less than a week ago, and I thought the best way to cope with the void it left behind is writing a post about how I&rsquo;ve seen it. This was my 5th year I jumped into it, but only the first one I actually did all the tasks. Just a small warning, this post contains some minor spoilers.</p>
<p>This year my aim was to do all the tasks as fast as possible, so I didn&rsquo;t use a new language. I started with <em>Python</em>, but after the second week, it became obvious that I don&rsquo;t know it enough to be fast with it, as I had to look up things every day, which took some time. After that, I moved to <em>Kotlin</em>, which was a bit slower because of the compilation time, but my better knowledge of the language paid off. I also rewrote my existing solutions to Kotlin to have them all in one place. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/PsHegger/advent-of-code">GitHub</a>, and as you can see, it has a few solutions for tasks from the previous years. I&rsquo;m planning on going back and doing every task ever released, but that&rsquo;ll take some time.</p>
<h2 id="story--tasks">Story &amp; Tasks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#story--tasks">#</a></h2>
<p>The story was fantastic, and I love that the calendar is a map showing our long journey.</p>
<p>The tasks were great, and they found a good balance between too easy to solve and so hard you don&rsquo;t have enough time for it.</p>
<p>There were multiple tasks where we had to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a>, but each of them was unique. We had to do it in <code>3d</code>, <code>4d</code>, and we also had one which used a hexagonal grid (which is great, because everyone should know that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY">Hexagons are the Bestagons</a>). I assume these tasks were a tribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a>, who died this year, and I think it was a great way to remember him.</p>
<p>There is one task I have to mention separately, and that is day 20, <em>Jurassic Jigsaw</em>. In my opinion, this was the most challenging task this year, but it was also the most fun. The first part was relatively easy (although it still took me one and a half hours to solve it), but while I was working on it, I already knew what will be the second part, and I dreaded it. After I finished the first part, I quickly learned that my suspicion was correct, and we had to assemble the whole image. First, I didn&rsquo;t know where to start because writing a backtracking algorithm (which was my first idea) seemed to be too big of a task (especially for a Sunday morning). Luckily as the time passed, I realized that the input constraints meant that we don&rsquo;t have to backtrack; we have to use them to build the image piece by piece. With that realization, I came up with a solution step by step, and in the end, it turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>Another honorable mention is day 21, which was one of the easier tasks, but it inspired me enough to solve it in SQL. Here&rsquo;s the solution for the first part. I have a working one for the second part, but I&rsquo;m not too fond of it because instead of a single query it uses a loop to build a table.</p>

<p>Another thing I have to mention is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">AoC subreddit</a>. That place is one of the best communities on the internet. Everyone was friendly and helpful, which is rare to find nowadays. There are a few posts asking for help, but most of the time I spent there was looking at the awesome visualizations and <em>Upping the Ante</em> posts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/?f=flair_name%3A%22Upping%20the%20Ante%22">Upping the Ante</a> posts are the ones where you can find wacky solutions no one in their right mind would think of (no offense, I find them entertaining and fun), like solving <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k5fmi7/day_01_solution_in_factorio/">day 1 in Factorio</a> or writing a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kgbylz/2020_day_119_solving_almost_all_puzzles_on_a_sega/">Sega MegaDrive</a> application that solves multiple days.</p>
<p>The other big part of the subreddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/?f=flair_name%3A%22Visualization%22">visualization</a> posts. These are some fun images or animations that show the solution or part of the story spectacularly. These were so fun that they even inspired me to create a way to create visualizations and make them for a few of my solutions.</p>
<p>These are the people standing in line for passport scanning on day 4 (of course, only those who had a valid passport).</p>
<p><img alt="/img/aoc-2020/Y2020D4.png" loading="lazy" src="/img/aoc-2020/Y2020D4.png"></p>
<p>This is the final image from day 20 (with the sea monsters highlighted).</p>
<p><img alt="/img/aoc-2020/Y2020D20.png" loading="lazy" src="/img/aoc-2020/Y2020D20.png"></p>
<p>And I even created a standalone <a href="https://github.com/PsHegger/aoc-2020-lobby-layout">Android application</a> that simulates the floor tiling from day 24 (unfortunately, I had to limit the space because the infinite version quickly became too slow to be displayed at 60 fps).</p>
<p><img alt="/img/aoc-2020/Y2020D24.gif" loading="lazy" src="/img/aoc-2020/Y2020D24.gif"></p>
<h2 id="some-statistics-for-the-end">Some statistics for the end<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#some-statistics-for-the-end">#</a></h2>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, I wanted to achieve good results every day. I also wanted to read the story and not just do the tasks, which took some extra time, but I didn&rsquo;t mind that.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that achieving the top 100 is a big challenge, and although I always hoped I&rsquo;d get at least 1 point, I never expected it. Overall I think I did a good job, my best position was <code>246th</code>, and my worst was <code>4412th</code>, with an average rank of <code>1770</code> (after both parts).</p>
<p><img alt="/img/aoc-2020/placements.png" loading="lazy" src="/img/aoc-2020/placements.png"></p>
<p>My most significant drop between part 1 and 2 was on day 17 (Conway Cubes). I finished the first part <code>326th</code>, but I needed 70 minutes to come up with a solution that can simulate an endless 4d space, and I dropped to <code>3047th</code> by the end of task 2.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my most significant gain was on day 15, where I quickly realized that 30 million is not a huge number, so I just plugged it into my part 1 solution and waited a bit (~14 seconds to be exact). It only took me 44 seconds to solve the 2nd part and finish the day in <code>942nd</code> place (after part 1 I was <code>2090th</code>).</p>
<p>My quickest solution was on day 3 (<code>0:07:15</code>), and my slowest was on day 20 (<code>4:08:57</code>). I spent a bit more than 25 hours writing all the solutions, and I also spent a lot more on doing other related things (e.g., porting the first two weeks to Kotlin and creating visualizations).</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn">What did I learn?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-did-i-learn">#</a></h2>
<p>Of course, Advent of Code is not only about fun, but it&rsquo;s also an excellent way for learning, and even though I didn&rsquo;t try to learn a new language this year, I have a few takeaways anyway.</p>
<p>This first is that the release time of the tasks is the worst and best possible at the same time (at least for me). It&rsquo;s the worst because it&rsquo;s at 6 am CET. If it were sooner, I wouldn&rsquo;t get up for it, and if it would be later, I would already be awake by the time it releases. On the other hand, this was the perfect time for me to finish the tasks before work.</p>
<p>I learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem">Chinese Remainder Theorem</a>, learned how to store infinite spaces in memory effectively, and I also learned that recursive regular expressions are not supported on the JVM.</p>
<p>I also realized multiple times that creating a general solution is too slow for a competition, and I should only concentrate on solving the task with the given input.</p>
<p>From day 5, I learned that using your brain can be quicker than implementing the algorithm described in the task. Initially, I implemented the <strong>binary space partitioning</strong>, and I only realized that it&rsquo;s just binary with other characters instead of 1s and 0s after checking the solution from other users.</p>
<p>From day 16, I learned that 0 shouldn&rsquo;t be used instead of <code>null</code>, even if this gives you a solution a bit quicker. For part 1, this wasn&rsquo;t a problem and gave the answer faster than having to check for nulls, but for part 2, it caused a big problem, which took me 40 minutes to debug.</p>
<p>Overall I enjoyed this past month, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to next year&rsquo;s puzzles.</p>
