      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re only here to try the game, you can do it on itch.io
I cannot even remember when was the first time I heard about Ludum Dare, but it was at least 5 years ago. Even back then, I was fascinated by the idea of creating a game in such a short time, but even though I wanted to try it, I had no game development experience at that time, so it always remained just a dream.</description>

      <title>Procedural Dungeon Generation</title>

      <description>Procedural generation is incredible. It is the key to writing games with endless content. Without it, Minecraft couldn’t have (nearly) infinite worlds with infinite terrain. Spelunky would only contain a few rooms, and we could learn the layout and enemy placement instead of learning the game mechanics. These are only a few examples, but there are a lot of games that use this mechanic for generating content.
In this article, I’d like to show you my way of generating a random dungeon that can be later used in a game.</description>
