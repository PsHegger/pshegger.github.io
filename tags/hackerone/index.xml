      <description>This year’s h@cktivitycon was held last Saturday, but even before it started, there was another event HackerOne had organized: this year’s CTF. It began on Thursday and ran for 48 hours. As I wasn’t following the events, it was already Friday when I realized it was running. I still had a bit more than a day to complete as many challenges as possible, so I decided to register and see how it goes.</description>
