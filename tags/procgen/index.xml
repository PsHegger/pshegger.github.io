      <description>Procedural generation is incredible. It is the key to writing games with endless content. Without it, Minecraft couldn’t have (nearly) infinite worlds with infinite terrain. Spelunky would only contain a few rooms, and we could learn the layout and enemy placement instead of learning the game mechanics. These are only a few examples, but there are a lot of games that use this mechanic for generating content.
In this article, I’d like to show you my way of generating a random dungeon that can be later used in a game.</description>
